Check out this website that shows your daily fortune. But the website is broken! You should only be able to see your daily fortune once, but you will see that you can keep pressing the button to get a new fortune. You need to use the .removeEventListener() method after a fortune is displayed.

Inside the showFortune() function, add a .removeEventListener() to prevent a new fortune from being displayed when a user tries to click the button element.
